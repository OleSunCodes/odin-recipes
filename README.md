# odin-recipes
Pre-Project: 3/12/2022
    This is my first official Odin Project. It will be a very basic website that will have some recipes. The code will utilize basic HTML, specifically list, links, images, and basic text.

Post-Project: 3/12/2022
    Overall went well. I feel confident in HTML basics. To be honest, the most I learned was more with the github add/commit/push cycle.
